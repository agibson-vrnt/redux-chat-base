# React + redux(or flux) interview test

Hi, thanks for taking the test. It's designed to see how well you can apply a modern pattern like redux (or other flux-derivative) to structure an application into maintainable chunks.

We've already provided some things for you, and there are a few ground rules.

But first, the goal of this test is to produce a working (though rudimentary) chat client using our existing peer-to-peer framework. You can read about the API for the chat framework here: 
[chat-service/readme.md](/chat-service/readme.md)

0. At the end of the test we must be able to open your app in three browser windows, join the room as a named user and communicate with the other users using basic text chat.
0. Please use this exercise to demonstrate your knowledge of ES6, following the react.js' community's conventions where possible.
0. Place your source code in a top-level folder named "js"
0. Place your SPA should be served out of the top-level folder named "app"
0. We've already set up Babel for use as a transpiler. Feel free to add other tools as appropriate via npm, and to install them globally if necessary (please keep a note though... :/ ).

##Designs
Below are the designs which give further detail about what you need to produce, with notes from our UX designer.

You'll find his original example HTML files in the app folder, along with the necessary CSS and png file. You shouldn't need to alter the CSS to complete this test.

Note the important note at the very bottom about keeping the scroll position fixed to the end of the conversation.
